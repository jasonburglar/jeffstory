<h1>Jeff, Deliverer of Food</h1>

<p>	Jeff’s cigarette burned almost to the filter and he flicked it out into the empty parking lot. He leaned up against his Toyota Camry and thought about lighting up another one. Suddenly, a seagull landed about six feet away. It trotted over to the smoldering butt and picked it up in its beak. It looked like it was smoking. Patting his pockets, Jeff realized he left his phone in the center console of his car. He knew if he opened the door, the seagull would fly away. The seagull just stared at him, with Jeff’s old cigarette still dangling from its beak like it was the James Dean of seagulls.</p>
<p>Fuck it, Jeff thought. I gotta get a picture of this.</p>
He opened his door slowly. The seagull didn’t budge. He leaned over and grabbed his phone. 
As he was opening his camera, his phone made a loud BADA-BA-BOP sound. The seagull squawked, dropping its cigarette. It stood there, staring.
	<p>“Dammit!”</p>
<p>He knew that sound meant he had a delivery. This time of day, most people were ordering sandwiches, so he was camped out in the parking lot of a long strip mall that was home to three different sandwich shops. Of course the delivery was for the sushi place down the street.
It was one of his usual runs, which meant he didn’t have to really talk to the guy at the counter. This was good because the guy’s name was Chun, or John, or maybe Yon? The guy had told him his name months ago, but his thick accent was hard to decipher, especially one syllable words. They’ve seen each other way too many times for Jeff to ask him again now.
	<p>“Hi Jeff” said Chun/John/Yon.
<p>“Hey [un]” replied Jeff, sort of just grunting a Yon-like syllable at him.
	<p>Why don’t I just say ‘Hey’ and stop there?  Jeff wondered.
<p>“Here your delivery. Have good day!”
<p>Jeff picked up the bags, muttered goodbye and gave a half-salute half-wave as he shuffled out the door.

<p>The seagull was now smoking a cigar, but no one saw it.

<p>The GPS was leading Jeff to a place further north than he usually went. He lit up another smoke then cracked the window. Tainted Love came on the radio, and Jeff turned it up. It would be two more cigarettes before he made it to the apartment complex. He turned the radio down so he could read the building numbers better. Building D….Building F…..Building R? Why the hell didn’t they just put the buildings in order? Finally he found the right one, Building G, nestled behind Building I and Complex Q.
<p>He grabbed the food and knocked on the door of Apartment G37. No answer. He knocked again. 
Just a minute! he heard someone answer. He heard footsteps rush up to the door. The woman who opened it was a very beautiful 30-something wearing a shrimp costume, holding the head of it under her arm.
<p>“Sorry!” she said, wiping the sweat off her forehead. “We were playing Sea Monster and I didn’t hear the door.”
<p>She motioned to a man on the couch dressed as a pirate, except he wasn’t wearing pants. Jeff noticed another shrimp on the floor.
<p>“I see where you got the craving for sushi” Jeff said.
<p>“Where?” asked Shrimp Woman.
<p>“Never mind. Have a nice day.”

<p>It was the third weirdest thing Jeff saw that day.

<p>A few miles away behind a dumpster, the seagull took another bong hit.
